# workflow-create-subtraction

A workflow for creating Virtool subtractions.

## Steps

1. Decompress FASTA file if necessary.
2. Build index for subtraction using `bowtie-build`.
3. Compress the FASTA file for upload and long term retention.
4. Upload the index files to the Virtool server and add sequence count and nucleotide distribution data to
the subtraction record.

## Contributing

### Commits

All commits must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0) specification.

These standardized commit messages are used to automatically publish releases using [`semantic-release`](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release)
after commits are merged to `main` from successful PRs.

**Example**

```text
feat: add API support for assigning labels to existing samples
```

Descriptive bodies and footers are required where necessary to describe the impact of the commit. Use bullets where appropriate.

Additional Requirements
1. **Write in the imperative**. For example, _"fix bug"_, not _"fixed bug"_ or _"fixes bug"_.
2. **Don't refer to issues or code reviews**. For example, don't write something like this: _"make style changes requested in review"_.
Instead, _"update styles to improve accessibility"_.
3. **Commits are not your personal journal**. For example, don't write something like this: _"got server running again"_
or _"oops. fixed my code smell"_.
